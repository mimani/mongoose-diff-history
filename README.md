mongoose-diff-history
=============

Stores and Manages all the differences and versions, any Mongo collection goes through it's lifecycle.

## Installation
---------------
### npm
``` sh
npm install mongoose-diff-history
```

## Operation
---------------
Each update will create a history record with [jsonDiff](https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch) of the change. This helps in tracking all the changes happened to an object from the beginning.

Following will be the structure of the diff history being saved:


diff Collection schema:

```
_id : mongo id of the diff object
collectionName: Name of the collection for which diff is saved
collectionId : Mongo Id of the collection being modified
diff: diff object
user: User who modified
reason: Why the collection is modified
createdAt: When the collection is modified
_v: version
```

## Usage
---------------
Use as you would any Mongoose plugin:

``` js
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory'),
    schema = new mongoose.Schema({ ... });
    schema.plugin(diffHistory.plugin);
```

The plugin also has an omit option which accepts either a string or array. This will omit the given
keys from history. Follows dot syntax for deeply nested values.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    someField: String,
    ignoredField: String,
    some: {
        deepField: String
    }
});
schema.plugin(diffHistory.plugin, { omit: ['ignoredField', 'some.deepField'] });
```

## Helper Methods
---------------
You can get all the histories created for an object using following method:

``` js
var diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');
diffHistory.getHistories(modelName, ObjectId, <expandable fields>, function (err, histories) {

}
```

You can get an older version of the object using following method:
``` js
var diffHistory = require('mongoose-diff-history/diffHistory');
diffHistory.getVersion(mongooseModel, ObjectId, version, function (err, oldObject) {

}
```



## Example
---------------
I have created an [example](https://github.com/mimani/mongoose-diff-history/tree/master/example) express service (documentation [here](https://github.com/mimani/mongoose-diff-history/blob/master/example/README.md)), demonstrating this plugin via an simple employee schema, checkout `example` directory in this repo.
